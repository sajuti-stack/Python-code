# This is my university's project for Data Science for Marketing course (instructor prof Nuno Antonio). We were given an hypothetical situation about tourism and pandemic. We had to do the analysis and share findings.
# The details of the project brief is as the following:

# Overview of the project
Tourism was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. National Tourism Board Organizations (NTBO) want to study users' generated content, such as Social Media reviews, to understand visitors patterns and if these patterns were affected by the pandemic.
Employing the CRISP-DM process model, your group are expected to act as a consultant for the Portuguese NTBO. Your job is to characterize and describe the patterns of visitants of Portuguese attractions and comparing it to Portugal's main tourism competitors. In addition, you can try to understand visitors' frequent itemset associations, similarities between attractions or visitors, or segment visitors using RFM (replacing Monetization by ratings for example).
    Examples of the type of analysis that can be done:
        Comparison of reviews frequency and rating distribution before and after the pandemic
        Comparison of the type of trip and origin of visitors
        Invest time in explaining the rationale of your choices and your business recommendations based on your findings.

# Deliverables
  Python source code (Jupyter notebook or .py files) and/or Excel files
  Powerpoint presentation (targeting non-technical audience)
  Report (targeting non-technical audience):
Maximum of 20 pages (excluding appendixes)
Minimum font size is 10
Should include an executive summary, background/context, a brief description of the problem, brief description of the methods, results and their discussion, focusing on insights and calls to action marketing-wise

# My contribution
  I have created the entire Python source code file on my own. I had to first understand the data, clean it & sort out the anomalies, find the answers of the business questions. My group members (2 others) created the presentation. I contributed to crafting the Report as well, as we had to explain our method and findings.
  It received high marks in the professors evaluation (16/20)
